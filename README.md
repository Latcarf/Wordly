# Project Overview
Welcome to my Java-based console word game, inspired by the popular Wordle game. This project is a testament to pure object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, developed without the use of any frameworks. It's a simple, yet engaging game that challenges your vocabulary in two languages: Ukrainian and English.

## Features
- **Language Selection**: Choose to play in either Ukrainian or English.
- **Game Modes**: Select between 5-letter or 6-letter word challenges.
- **Dynamic Word List**: For Ukrainian, the game integrates a comprehensive dictionary, ensuring that only valid Ukrainian words of the selected length are accepted.
- **Limited Guesses**: Each mode contains 10 words to guess. Once you've guessed them all, you can switch modes or languages to continue the fun.
- **Helpful Hints and Surrender Option**: Need a hint? Stuck on a word? My game provides hints to guide you, or you can choose to surrender and reveal the word.
- **Rulebook**: New to the game? Check out the rules to understand how to play.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game from your console.
2. **Choose Your Language**: Select either Ukrainian or English.
3. **Select Your Mode**: Decide whether you want to guess a 5-letter word or a 6-letter word.
4. **Start Guessing**: Input your guesses. Remember, you can ask for a hint or surrender if you're stuck.
5. **Switch Modes or Languages**: Once you've guessed all the words in one mode, try the other mode or switch the language for a new challenge.
6. **Enjoy!**: Have fun testing and expanding your vocabulary.
